# BookBox

BookBox is an student-to-student book shop developed as main project of course Advanced Web Programming at Link√∂ping University 2009 by Tobias Lundin & Ulf Davidsson.

Basically it's a PHP site using Symfony framework and jQuery (1.3.2) with jQuery UI. Students add books and connect them to courses, prices and artwork are scraped from real book stores and users can buy or sell to each other or rate/comment on products.

Original tagline was *to lower the costs of drunkards for students...* (not even proper english)

Actual idea was to reduce waste (read any of your old school books lately?) and unnecessary expenses for students as some litterature can get quite expensive.
